# Phylogenetic Trees using ete3 module
Phylogenetic trees, also known as evolutionary trees or cladograms, are graphical representations that depict the evolutionary relationships among different species or groups of organisms. They illustrate the evolutionary history and common ancestry of species based on shared characteristics, genetic information, or other relevant data.

Phylogenetic trees are constructed using various methods and techniques, including molecular sequencing data, anatomical features, fossil records, or a combination of these sources. The tree branches represent the divergence of species over time, with the tips of the branches representing the present-day species or groups and the internal nodes representing common ancestors.
